Currently there are three spring profiles that can be used to run the application (`application.yml`, `application-local.yml` and `application-development.yml`).

To launch the application with a specific profile run
``` sh
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=local ./gradlew app:bootRun
# or
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=local
./gradlew app:bootRun
```

## Development
You can run the service locally for evaluation or development purposes using the provided `docker-compose.yml` file in the development folder. This will launch a Keycloak and a Postgres db in the background.

To start the service execute the `run.sh` in the development folder:
```sh
development/run.sh
```

Example request against the preferences service can be run in your preferred IDE with the `request.http` file from the development folder.

You can access the Keycloak UI via browser.
URL: http://localhost:8080
**username:** admin  
**password:** password

To stop the preferences service, Keycloak and the databases run:
```sh
development/stop.sh
```
